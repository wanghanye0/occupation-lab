I am a rising third-year PhD student in Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, as well as a joint PhD student in Demography. My research interests are social stratification and inequality, education, migration, and population geography. In particular, my work explores dynamic environmental, social, and familial contexts in childhood and their socioeconomic consequences across the life course.
